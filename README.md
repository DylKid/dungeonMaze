Dungeon Maze is a basic maze game that involves moving through a maze before the time runs out. Coins will increase the amount of time that you have left. Treasure chests will increase the time and move you to the next level. Every time the level advances the clock counts faster and the level is 1x1 larger.

Automated testing using GridPlayer is incorporated, check out the testing module, and gridPlayer package.
